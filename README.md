## Getting Started: What to Bring & Install

To make the most of our sessions, please come prepared with the following:

### Essentials:
*   **Your Laptop:** Ensure it's fully charged.
*   **Your Study Data:** Have your cleaned dataset ready, preferably in `.csv` format. Store it in an easy-to-find folder on your laptop.

### Software Installation:

1.  **R Statistical Language:**
    *   This is the core programming language we'll be using.
    *   If you haven't installed it yet, download it from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). Choose your operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows) and follow the installation instructions.

2.  **RStudio Desktop (Free Version):**
    *   RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for working with R, making it easier to write code, manage projects, and visualize data.
    *   Download it from the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Scroll down to the "RStudio Desktop Free" section and select the installer appropriate for your operating system.

### Quick Setup Tip:
*   **Installation Order:** It's important to **install R first, and then install RStudio Desktop.**
*   **Verify Installation:** Once both are installed, open RStudio. If you see a console window (usually in the bottom-left pane), you're ready to go!
